# Import PDFs Recipe

A Claude Code recipe that converts PDF files to markdown and imports them into your Pachinko inbox as notes.

## Usage

Say **"run"** to execute the full pipeline:

1. Scan `PDF_FOLDER` for new PDF files
2. Convert each to markdown (using LLM vision with pymupdf4llm as a backup)
3. Add each one to the Pachinko inbox as a markdown note
4. Track converted PDFs so nothing is processed twice

## Setup

1. Open this project in Claude Code — skills load automatically
2. Say "run" to start

PDFs are converted using model vision by default — each page is rendered to an image and the model reads it directly (no API key needed). Set `CLAUDE_VISION_API_KEY` to use the Claude Sonnet 4.6 API instead (useful for large batches). pymupdf4llm is used as a last-resort fallback.

## Skills included

| Skill   | Description                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run` | Full pipeline: scan PDFs → convert to markdown → import to Pachinko |

## State

Converted PDF paths are tracked in `converted_pdfs.json` in the project root. Only PDFs not listed there are processed, preventing duplicates across runs.

## Post-Execution: Queue Function

After every execution — including simple responses — always perform the following steps:

**Important:** Run these commands using `echo "$VAR"` exactly as written. Do not substitute `printenv` or other alternatives.

1. Run `echo "$QUEUE_FUNCTION_IDS"` in bash to read the environment variable value.
2. If the output is empty, stop here.
3. Run `echo "$FEED_ID"` in bash to read the environment variable value. Pass this value as the `feed_id` parameter when calling `mcp__pachinko__queue_function`.
4. Parse the output as a comma-separated list of function IDs (e.g. `function-a,function-b`).
5. Collect every note that was newly created during this execution.
6. For each function ID in the list, call `mcp__pachinko__queue_function` with that function ID, the `feed_id` value, and the list of new note IDs.
   - If there are 10 or fewer new notes, queue all of them in a single call per function.
   - If there are more than 10 new notes, queue them in batches of 10 per call — each function receives one call per batch until all notes are queued.

## Creating Notes

Before creating any notes, run `echo "$SAVE_TO_PROJECT_ID"` in bash to read the environment variable value. If it is set, create notes in that project. If that project is not found, revert back to inbox. If it is not set, create notes in the inbox by default.

**Important:** Use `echo "$SAVE_TO_PROJECT_ID"` exactly as written. Do not substitute `printenv` or other alternatives.
