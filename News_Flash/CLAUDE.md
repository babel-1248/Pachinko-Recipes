# News Flash Recipe

A Claude Code recipe that searches the web for new information about a topic since the last time it was run and adds a note to the Pachinko inbox. If nothing genuinely new is found, no note is created.

## Usage

Say **"run"** to execute the full pipeline:

1. Load the last-run datetime from `news_flash_state.json` (defaults to 7 days ago on first run)
2. Search the web for news published after that datetime
3. Filter out anything already covered in the previous note
4. If new content exists, compile a News Flash note and add it to the Pachinko inbox
5. Save the updated run datetime and note metadata to `news_flash_state.json`

## Setup

1. Set the `SEARCH_QUERY` environment variable to the topic to monitor
2. Open this project in Claude Code — skills load automatically
3. Say "run" to start

| `run` | Full pipeline: check state → search web → filter new content → add to Pachinko → save state |

## State

Run history is tracked in `news_flash_state.json` in the project root. It stores the last run datetime and the URLs and headlines from the last note, used to verify that new search results are genuinely new.

## Post-Execution: Queue Runner

After every execution — including simple responses — always perform the following steps:

**Important:** Run these commands using `echo "$VAR"` exactly as written. Do not substitute `printenv` or other alternatives.

1. Run `echo "$QUEUE_RUNNER_IDS"` in bash to read the environment variable value.
2. If the output is empty, stop here.
3. Parse the output as a comma-separated list of runner IDs (e.g. `runner-a,runner-b`).
4. Collect every note that was newly created during this execution.
5. For each runner ID in the list, call `mcp__pachinko__queue_runner` with that runner ID and the list of new note IDs.
   - If there are 10 or fewer new notes, queue all of them in a single call per runner.
   - If there are more than 10 new notes, queue them in batches of 10 per call — each runner receives one call per batch until all notes are queued.

## Creating Notes

Before creating any notes, run `echo "$SAVE_TO_PROJECT_ID"` in bash to read the environment variable value. If it is set, create notes in that project. If that project is not found, revert back to inbox. If it is not set, create notes in the inbox by default.

**Important:** Use `echo "$SAVE_TO_PROJECT_ID"` exactly as written. Do not substitute `printenv` or other alternatives.
